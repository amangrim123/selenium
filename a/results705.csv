Mykhaylo Mudrykha has been overwhelmed by the number of texts from Arsenal supporters pleading with him to migrate to North London.


Mudryk has become one of the top young wingers in Europe this season.


With eight goals and eight assists in just 16 appearances for Shakhtar Donetsk, the 21-year-old has been nothing short of remarkable.


When given room to counterattack, Mudryk has destroyed teams with his fast pace and direct running style.


It now seems all but certain that Mudryk will depart from Shakhtar in 2023 for a significant move elsewhere.


Arsenal is one of Mudryk's main suitors.


Arsenal considered acquiring Mudryk before the summer transfer window closed, but no agreement could be reached.


Naturally, Mudryk's price has increased since then, but Arsenal are still interested, according to Fabrizio Romano, who claims that the Gunners have had good communication with Mudryk's representatives.


In a recent conversation with Oleksandr Zinchenko's wife, Vlada, Mudryk made some remarks about Arsenal.


Speaking on her YouTube channel, Mudryk said that the Arsenal supporters had amazed him.


Mudryk claimed that one of his Instagram postings had received more than 500 comments from Arsenal supporters encouraging him to join, as translated by Ukrainian football account Zorya Londonsk.


Mudryk acknowledged that no other club's supporters had ever inundated him with messages in this way, and he has been startled by the sheer number of Arsenal supporters who now follow him on social media.


We can all agree that Arsenal supporters are fervent; if an Arsenal player is involved, they tend to win the majority of the votes.


It appears that their comments have left a lasting impression on the winger ahead of January as they are now vehemently attempting to persuade Mudryk to sign.
