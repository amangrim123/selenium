Midfielder Tyler Adams of Leeds United and the USA has received praise from Tim Sherwood on Talk Sports (8:36am, November 15, 2022).


Adams has pleased the former Tottenham Hotspur manager, who thinks the Leeds and USA player is fiery.


When analyzing the USA team for the 2022 World Cup championships in Qatar, Sherwood made the remarks about the 23-year-old.


In Qatar, Adams is a member of the American team.


Regarding Adams, Sherwood remarked, "I truly like that child." He seems to have a feisty disposition, in my opinion.


Tyler Adams has performed admirably for Jesse Marsch's team thus far this season and is one of Leeds United's greatest and most crucial players in our opinion.


The 23-year-old has played 13 times for the West Yorkshire club in the Premier League so far this season.


The American is capable of competing in the middle of the field, disrupting the opposition's play, and advancing the team.


It was sad when Adams was dismissed for Leeds against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League last weekend.


We are confident that the young American will correct his error and come back stronger than before.
