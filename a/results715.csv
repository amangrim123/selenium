According to rumors, Greg Hardy or Shannon Briggs could be called up at the last minute to challenge Hasim Rahman Jr. on Saturday night.


The son of a former heavyweight champion, Hasim Rahman Jr., was scheduled to fight Vitor Belfort on a Misfits Boxing event sponsored by KSI in Austin, Texas.


Belfort, however, has been disqualified at the beginning of fight week owing to COVID.


Tweeting in response, Rahman Jr. wished @VitorBelfort a speedy recovery.


Inshallah, I'll handle things on Saturday, and together, we can achieve our goal by 2023.


He said, "Y all going to LOVE this new opponent," after that.


Boxing Scene predicts that either Briggs or Hardy will win.


Former heavyweight world champion Briggs has previously fought people like Vitali Klitschko, Lennox Lewis, and George Foreman.


He hasn't fought since 2016, though, and he's now 50 years old.


Hardy is a former NFL defensive end and MMA fighter who has since made a career in boxing.


The 34-year-old beat Michael Cook in the second round by knockout just one month after turning professional.
