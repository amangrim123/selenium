After being called out on a crucial check swing call late in Game 3 of the NLCS at Citizens Bank Ballpark on Friday night in Philadelphia, Jurickson Profar lost it.


In the top of the ninth inning, Profar's San Diego Padres were trailing 4-2 and had a runner on with no one out. Seranthony Dominguez delivered a ball inside that nearly hit the Padres left fielder as Profar faced him with a full count.


Profar began to swing then stopped. Todd Tichenor, the third base umpire, denied the Phillies' appeal after stating that Profar left. Profar erupted over the call, causing him to be ejected.


View of the check swing is as follows:


I don't believe that he swung at that pitch, if you ask me. Therefore, I believe that was a poor decision.


That also made a significant difference.


The Padres were down to their final two outs rather than having runners on first and second with a rally building against a closer attempting a 6-out save. After that, Anthony convinced Trent Grisham and Austin Nola to call time on the match.


Currently, Philly is up 2-1 in the series.
