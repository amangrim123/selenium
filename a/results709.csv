Whether you've been a fan since the beginning or have just started, it's likely that you can't avoid the enthusiasm surrounding Yellowstone. It has developed into one of the most well-liked shows in recent memory throughout the years. Every season, the return is greatly awaited and accompanied by a lot of rumors.


The American neo-Western drama, which was created by Taylor Sheridan and John Linson, had its debut in 2018, and since then, both its homes on the Paramount Network and, more recently, Paramount Plus, have been popular hangouts for TV fans.


The series' soundtrack was actually created by a variety of accomplished artists, immersing viewers in the disputes along the borders of a sizable cow ranch, an Indian reservation, and land developers.


Fortunately, on Sunday, November 13th 2022, the show returned for a fifth season, and a musical ensemble helped the premiere go off without a hitch. So let's zoom in on the band from the season 5 premiere of Yellowstone.


Shane Smith & The Saints are the band featured in the Yellowstone season 5 premiere, and they play three songs: Fire In The Ocean, Alex, and Dance The Night Away.


The trio, from Austin, Texas, formed in 2011, and all three of the tracks are streamable on Spotify. There are also four albums accessible for new fans to check out. They go by the names Coast, Geronimo, Hail Mary, and Live from the Desert in chronological order.


The band consists of vocalist Shane Smith, lead guitarist Dustin Schaefer, bassist Chase Satterwhite, drummer Zach Stover, and fiddler Bennett Brown.


They did appear in the previous season, though their attendance at John Dutton's governor's ball is sure to win them some friends.


For those who are unaware, Travis Wheatley is portrayed by the show's co-creator, and in a scene where he is driving Jimmy and the band's music is playing on the radio, he expresses his appreciation for it.


The band's official Instagram account may be found at shanesmithmusic.


As a result of their exposure on Yellowstone, they currently have an outstanding 75k followers, and we are confident that number will increase.


The most popular song on Spotify right now is All I See Is You, and they currently have 539k monthly listeners.

In a prior interview, Shane was asked by the interviewer for American Highways what he thought he would be doing if he weren't a musician:


"I doubt I'll ever be able to let go of this piece of myself. Writing music and using lyrics and melody to communicate ideas and tales has grown to be such a large part of who I am. It s something I m very enthusiastic about I m proud of what we ve accomplished and the things I ve had to go through. I'm sure the other guys share the same sentiments.


"You take a lot of satisfaction in that," he continued, "when you go through some terrible times and trying conditions to accomplish something, and you come out on the other side."
