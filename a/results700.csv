The most recent feature added to Instagram is called Notes, and it's part of the company's ongoing effort to make the site engaging for users.


The Instagram app has undergone numerous changes in 2022, including modifications to the design, feed, Reels, Stories, and DMs.


Many of the new features haven't been warmly received by users, but the November update is receiving positive feedback on social media.


What do notes do? And how does one become added to a profile? Continue reading to learn more about the feature.


You can now add a Note, a state that is only shown for 24 hours, to your profile using the brand-new feature called Notes.


If you only want to share it with the people you've added to your close friends list in Settings, you can do so.


Alternately, you can send the Note to each of your pals. Everyone you follow on Instagram who also follows you back will see it if you do this.


Similar to WhatsApp's status feature, which lets you post a message to your profile, Instagram Notes also allows for replies.


You are allowed to write whatever you want, but you are limited to 60 characters, and your friends will see it in the DMs section.


By selecting the paper aircraft icon in the top right corner of the Instagram app, you may navigate to the DM section and post a Note there.


Then, you ought to see a heading that reads "Notes" at the top. There will be a Plus sign on the left side and it will display all the status updates that your friends have made.


When you tap the +, a box with the words "share what's on your mind" will appear. You type your note here, hit Enter, and the status will share.


Keep in mind that the Note will automatically vanish after 24 hours. Even though it hasn't been 24 hours yet, you can always set a new note.


If you don't see the Notes function in your Direct Messages, it's probably not yet available in your area.


People first started receiving Notes in July 2022, but it was only a trial at the time. With the most recent version, it appears to have been implemented as a legitimate function.


As with other new features, though, they aren't always implemented across all accounts at once; rather, it's frequently done in phases.


The feature might be added to your account if you have the most recent version of the Instagram app loaded.


If not, you are forced to wait because there is nothing else you can do. Notes should eventually be accessible in your nation.
