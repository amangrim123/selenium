In every group game involving Brazil, England, and France, Sky Bet and talkSPORT have increased the odds for there to be more than 0.5 goals from 4/6 to EVENS, which you can add directly to your bet slip here.


Each game in the group stage including England, France, and Brazil has over 0.5 goals available at 1/1 now.

England has been placed in Group B with Iran, the United States, and Wales. Their opening match is against Iran on Monday, November 22, at 1 p.m.


Brazil, the five-time champion, enters this year's competition as the betting favorite to win their first World Cup trophy since 2002, the only other time the event was held in Asia.


The star-studded Brazilians will begin their campaign against the Serbs on Thursday, November 24, at 7 p.m. They are in Group G this year together with Cameroon, Serbia, and Switzerland.


France, the defending champion, is one of the favorites to win the World Cup trophy next month, making them just the third team to win the trophy back-to-back.
