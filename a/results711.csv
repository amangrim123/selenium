The Michelin-starred chef and TheIndecent Proposalstar were first romantically linked in March. At that time, they were photographed sitting together in the front row at Paris Fashion Week.


A close source informed Us Weekly that Demi met Daniel through shared acquaintances about a month later, and the two of them hit it off right immediately.
