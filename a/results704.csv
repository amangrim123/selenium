According to CMW, Tottenham Hotspur head coach Antonio Conte desires to bring Inter Milan defender Stefan de Vrij to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in January.


The Italian news site reported that De Vrij and Tottenham manager Conte had a direct conversation about a possible transfer when the window opens in January.


When he was in command of Inter, Conte collaborated with the 30-year-old international center-back from the Netherlands.


De Vrij's contract at Inter expires at the end of the current campaign, and his agency intends to negotiate a new contract with the former Italian champions, according to CMW, who also stated that Tottenham would be prepared to pounce in January if a deal could not be made.


From our perspective, Tottenham Hotspur's chances of acquiring Stefan de Vrij from Inter Milan during the January transfer window are slim.


Yes, Inter might lose the Dutchman for free in the summer, but it's unlikely they'll get much in return for him now in January.


De Vrij is a key player for Inter, and it would make sense for the Nerazzurri to maintain hold of him for the rest of the season.


Inter has advanced to the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League and hopes to finish in the top four of the Serie A standings this year.


De Vrij, who makes $117,000 a week (SalarySport), has made three starts and one substitute appearance for Inter this season in the UEFA Champions League and has made 11 starts and one start in Serie A.
